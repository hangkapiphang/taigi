1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The Frog Prince.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,200
A big shout out to Ellie and Alexis

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,000
for requesting today's story.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Once upon a time in a kingdom deep in the forest,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
there lived a young princess.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
She was fair and lovely,

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,000
with hair like sunlight and eyes like the clear sky.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Her favorite treasure was a golden ball,

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,000
which she loved to toss into the air and catch

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,800
over and over, especially near the cool well

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,000
in the far end of the palace garden.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Day after day she tossed it high into the air,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
laughing as it glittered in the sunlight.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
One warm afternoon as she played,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,500
the ball slipped from her hands,

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,000
bounced upon the edge of the well,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and fell with a splash into the water below.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,500
The well was deep,

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
and no matter how she leaned she could not see its bottom.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh my beautiful golden ball.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,500
If only I could have you back again,

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
I would give anything, anything in the world.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why do you weep so, Princess?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It is my golden ball, it has fallen into the well,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and I shall never see it again.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can fetch it for you,

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
but what will you give me in return?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh dear frog, I will give you jewels and pearls,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and even the golden crown I wear.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have no need for your riches.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But if you will promise to let me be your companion,

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,500
to sit beside you at table,

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,000
to eat from your plate, to drink from your cup,

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and to sleep upon your bed,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
then I will dive down and bring back your ball.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The princess shuddered at the thought.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
A slimy frog at my table? On my pillow? Never!

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yet she wished so dearly for her toy that she said quickly:

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, yes.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I promise whatever you ask.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But the princess had no thought of keeping her word.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
At once the frog plunged beneath the water.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Moments later he returned, pushing the golden ball up.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,500
The princess snatched it joyfully.

45
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,000
Without another thought, she ran back to the palace.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Wait Princess! Take me with you,

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
as you promised!

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
My ball, my lovely ball.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That night as the royal family sat down to supper,

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
a knock sounded at the Great Hall door.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,500
The princess went to open it,

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,000
and there sitting upon the step was the frog.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Princess open the door!

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Do you not remember your promise by the well?

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let me sit beside you and eat from your plate.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The princess turned pale

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and slammed the door shut.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
What troubles you my daughter?

59
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
There is a frog outside.

60
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
He says that I promised that he'd eat with me,

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
but I do not want him here.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A princess must keep her word, even to a frog.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Bring him in.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Reluctantly the princess opened the door.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The frog hopped across the floor up to the table and said:

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Lift me up beside you.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Against her will she obeyed.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He sat next to her and demanded:

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
"Now push your plate closer that I may eat as you do."

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
She pushed the plate and the frog ate heartily from her food.

71
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,500
He drank from her goblet and left wet prints on the linen.

72
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,000
The princess was disgusted,

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
but the king only nodded gravely, watching her honor her promise.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,500
I am weary now.

75
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,000
Take me to your chamber that I may sleep upon your bed.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Father must I truly allow this creature to sleep near me?

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
A princess must keep her word, even to a frog.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So with heavy heart she carried the frog upstairs,

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
placed him upon a cushion by her bedside and lay down.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I am lonely down here.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Kiss me goodnight princess, as you would a dear companion.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,500
The princess trembled with horror. Kiss a frog? Never!

83
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:29,000
Yet her father's words rang in her ears: a promise must be kept.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
She squeezed her eyes shut, bent quickly,

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and pressed her lips to his cold damp skin.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In that instant the frog was gone.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,500
And in his place stood a young prince,

88
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,000
his eyes kind and shining.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Who are you?

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,500
I was a prince enchanted by a wicked witch.

91
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Only when a princess kept her word and kissed me

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
could the spell be broken.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You have set me free.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Will you come with me to my kingdom and be my queen?

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes I will.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The next day a carriage arrived sent from the prince's kingdom.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,500
Driving it was his loyal servant Iron Heinrich,

98
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
whose heart had been bound with three iron bands

99
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,000
for fear it would break while his master lived under the curse.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Go well my child and always remember to honor your word.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Happily the princess left her father's kingdom behind.

102
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What was that sound?

103
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It is Heinrich. His heart is so full of joy

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
that the iron bands around it are breaking.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,500
The prince and princess rode away together to his kingdom,

106
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,000
where they were married and lived happily ever after.
